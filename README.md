  
  Gravity is a new type of distributed ledger system of public blockchains. It adopts a new DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) storage and consensus mechanism, as well as the smart contract scheme based on DAG. Not only can the transactions be settled quickly on the Gravity network and data be shared timely, but also the decentralized application (DApp) can be developed flexibly on the platform. In addition, Gravity also makes the cross-chain technology between public blockchain and consortium blockchain possible, opening up the channel of value exchange between blockchains.

Gravity is committed to building an ecosystem of global trading, with the aim of providing the global markets with low-cost, efficient decentralized services.
